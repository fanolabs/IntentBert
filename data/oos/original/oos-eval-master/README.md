# An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction
Repository that accompanies [An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1131/).


## FAQs
### 1. What are the relevant files?
See `data/data_full.json` for the "full" dataset. This is the dataset used in Table 1 (the "Full" columns). This file contains 150 "in-scope" intent classes, each with 100 train, 20 validation, and 30 test samples. There are 100 train and validation out-of-scope samples, and 1000 out-of-scope test samples. 

### 2. What is the name of the dataset?
The dataset was not given a name in the original paper, but [others](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04807.pdf) have called it `CLINC150`.

### 3. What is this dataset for?
This dataset is for evaluating the performance of intent classification systems in the presence of "out-of-scope" queries. By "out-of-scope", we mean queries that do not fall into any of the system-supported intent classes. Most datasets include only data that is "in-scope". Our dataset includes both in-scope and out-of-scope data. You might also know the term "out-of-scope" by other terms, including "out-of-domain" or "out-of-distribution". 

### 4. What language is the dataset in?
All queries are in English.

### 5. How does your dataset/evaluation handle multi-intent queries?
All samples/queries in our dataset are single-intent samples. We consider the problem of multi-intent classification to be future work.

### 6. How did you gather the dataset?
We used crowdsourcing to generate the dataset. We asked crowd workers to either paraphrase "seed" phrases, or respond to scenarios (e.g. "pretend you need to book a flight, what would you say?"). We used crowdsourcing to generate data for both in-scope and out-of-scope data.
